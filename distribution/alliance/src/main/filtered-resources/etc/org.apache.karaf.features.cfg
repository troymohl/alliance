# By default, the feature resolver checks the service requirements/capabilities of
# bundles for new features (xml schema >= 1.3.0) in order to automatically install
# the required bundles.
# The following flag can have those values:
#   - disable: service requirements are completely ignored - disables auto refresh bundles
#   - default: service requirements are ignored for old features
#   - enforce: service requirements are always verified

serviceRequirements=disable
