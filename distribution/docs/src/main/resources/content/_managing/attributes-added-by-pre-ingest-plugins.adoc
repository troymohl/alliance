* The <<{reference-prefix}default_security_attribute_plugin,Default Security Attribute Plugin>> is a configurable plugin that maps system high user attribute values to metacard attribute values.
"System high user attributes" refers to the attributes on the ${branding}'s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain[Second-Level Domain] {external-link} user, who is defined in the `etc/users.attributes` file.
For example, if `https://localhost:8993` is the ${branding}'s domain name, then the `localhost` user has the system high user attributes.
See <<{architecture-prefix}configuring_the_default_security_attribute_plugin,Configuring the Default Security Attribute Plugin>> for configuration details.
Note that if security markings have already been applied to the metacard, the values will not be overridden by this plugin.
