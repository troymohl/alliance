In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting, …  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting, …  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS.
